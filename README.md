# LOGO
Changes made to the Shopify Store LOGO can be seen here: https://logo-phone-store.myshopify.com/

Note: This is a Shopify development store (meaning that it's not an actual client store and is created for development purposes only).

Shopify's ThemeKit was used to run the code and update the site via the store's API and ThemeKits' ``theme watch`` command.
PowerShell was the terminal used to run ThemeKit, since Choco package was installed on there.
