# LOGO
Changes made to the Shopify Store LOGO can be seen here: https://logo-phone-store.myshopify.com/

Shopify's ThemeKit was used to run the code and update the site via the store's API and ThemeKits' ``theme watch`` command.
PowerShell was the terminal used to run ThemeKit, since Choco package was installed on there.
